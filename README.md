PantryPal is an application which notifies users when their food is getting expired
## Household food waste problems and underlying causes:
Food waste presents a significant environmental problem due to its contribution to the 
emission of greenhouse gases and the extravagant use of resources during its 
production, distribution, and storage (Parfitt et al., 2010). If food waste were a country, it 
would be the third largest carbon-emitting country in the world, with a carbon footprint 
equal to 3.6 GtCO2 eq (FAO, 2011). 
More than half of the total food waste are coming from the households. In the UK, 
household food waste is the largest contributor of the national total food waste, 
contributing more than eight million tonnes per year, costing an amount of £12 billion, and 
it is responsible for 3% of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions (Quested et al., 2011). 
Moreover, food wasted at home accounts for the highest carbon emissions due to the 
accumulation of greenhouse gases along supply chain processes (FAO, 2011).  
A research in the UK found that the biggest reason of household food loss is that people 
forget to consume the goods in time (Quested & Johnson, 2009). Various studies suggest 
a solution to reduce preventable household food loss by tracking and informing 
consumers about food expiration dates and persuading them to adopt methods to cook 
food creatively and in more diverse ways before it expires (Farr-Wharton et al., 2014; Lim 
et al., 2017).  
To address this problem, PantryPal is a database-driven application designed to assist 
every household in reducing domestic food waste. Developed by an innovative team, 
PantryPal targets family members who buy groceries in bulk and forget to use those 
products before they expire, causing preventable food loss. After purchasing groceries, 
using PantryPal, users receive notifications on the expiration date, storage instructions, 
and suggested cooking recipes, which are tailor-made based on users’ purchased 
product lists, to encourage them to consume products before the expiration dates. Users 
can effortlessly query product information like allergy ingredients, expiration information, 
suitable cooking ingredients, and instructions for each person’s physical goal. 
Furthermore, PantryPal offers a social platform for users to share cooking recipes, food 
preparation, and preservation tips and users can feedback, comment on each other’s 
posts. PantryPal database will be implemented using both relational and NoSQL 
database models, including RDBMS and MongoDB.
